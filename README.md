In this odin project, I will create a web page from scratch, it will have a collection of recipes, for the moment it will only be a basic HTML code, in the future we will continue working with CSS code and JavaScript.

In this project I will use all the skills learned in HTML, I will also learn how to make good commits, to develop skills that will serve me as a basis to be a good web developer.

Enjoy this adventure
